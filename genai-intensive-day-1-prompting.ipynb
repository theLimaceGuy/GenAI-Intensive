You don't need to read the whitepaper to use this notebook, but the papers will give you some theoretical context and background to complement this interactive notebook.\n\n\n## Before you begin\n\nIn this notebook, you'll start exploring prompts and prompt parameters using the Python SDK and AI Studio. For some inspiration, you might enjoy exploring some apps that have been built using the Gemini family of models. Here are a few that we like, and we think you will too.\n\n* [TextFX](https://textfx.withgoogle.com/) is a suite of AI-powered tools for rappers, made in collaboration with Lupe Fiasco,\n* [SQL Talk](https://sql-talk-r5gdynozbq-uc.a.run.app/) shows how you can talk directly to a database using the Gemini API,\n* [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google/) uses Gemini models to build your own personal AI research assistant.\n\n\n### A note on the Gemini API and Vertex AI\n\nIn the whitepapers, most of the example code uses the Enterprise [Vertex AI platform](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai). In contrast, this notebook, along with the others in this series, will use the [Gemini Developer API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/) and [AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).\n\nBoth APIs provide access to the Gemini family of models, and the code to interact with the models is very similar. Vertex provides a world-class platform for enterprises, governments and advanced users that need powerful features like data governance, ML ops and deep Google Cloud integration.\n\nAI Studio is free to use and only requires a compatible Google account to log in and get started. It is deeply integrated with the Gemini API, which comes with a generous [free tier](https://ai.google.dev/pricing) that you can use to run the code in these exercises.\n\nIf you are already set up with Google Cloud, you can check out the [Enterprise Gemini API](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/model-reference/inference) through Vertex AI, and run the samples directly from the supplied whitepapers.","metadata":{"id":"csNPnkuCobmG"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Get started with Kaggle notebooks\n\nIf this is your first time using a Kaggle notebook, welcome!

The birds outside, usually a source of endless entertainment, were huddled in their nests, shivering in the unseasonal chill. Bartholomew, restless and yearning for adventure, decided to take matters into his own paws.\n\nHe slipped out the back door, a silent shadow in the damp morning air. The world was a symphony of smells – damp earth, blooming roses, and the tantalizing aroma of freshly baked bread from the bakery down the street. Bartholomew, his whiskers twitching with anticipation, followed the scent, his sleek body weaving through the maze of garden fences and flowerbeds.\n\nHe found himself in a bustling market square, a kaleidoscope of colors and sounds. He watched, mesmerized, as vendors hawked their wares, their voices a rhythmic chant. A plump, red-cheeked woman, her hands dusted with flour, offered him a piece of warm bread. Bartholomew, ever the gentleman, accepted with a polite purr.\n\nHis adventure continued, leading him through cobblestone streets and past quaint shops. He encountered a grumpy old dog, a mischievous squirrel, and a flock of pigeons who, after a brief standoff, decided to share their crumbs with him. He even found himself the center of attention at a children's park, where a group of giggling toddlers chased him around, their laughter echoing through the air.\n\nAs the sun began to set, casting long shadows across the town, Bartholomew felt a pang of longing for home. He had had his fill of adventure, and the familiar scent of his favorite catnip toy beckoned him back. He retraced his steps, his heart full of memories and his paws weary from his journey.\n\nHe slipped back into the house, greeted by the warm glow of the kitchen light and the comforting scent of his human's dinner. He curled up on his favorite cushion, a contented purr rumbling in his chest. Bartholomew, the adventurous cat, had returned home, his spirit enriched by the day's discoveries. He knew, however, that the world was a vast and wondrous place, and he would be back, ready for more adventures, when the time was right. \n"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Prompting\n\nThis section contains some prompts from the chapter for you to try out directly in the API.
